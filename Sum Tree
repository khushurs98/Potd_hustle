'''
Given a Binary Tree. Check for the Sum Tree for every node except the leaf node. Return true if it is a Sum Tree otherwise, return false.

A SumTree is a Binary Tree where the value of a node is equal to the sum of the nodes present in its left subtree and right subtree. An empty tree is also a Sum Tree as the sum of an empty tree can be considered to be 0. A leaf node is also considered a Sum Tree.
