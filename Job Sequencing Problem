'''
Given a set of n jobs where each jobi has a deadline and profit associated with it.

Each job takes 1 unit of time to complete and only one job can be scheduled at a time. We earn the profit associated with a job if and only if the job is completed by its deadline.

Find the number of jobs done and the maximum profit.

#Solution Code

class Solution:
    def JobScheduling(self, Jobs, n):
        Jobs.sort(key=lambda x: x.profit, reverse=True)
        maxDeadline = max(job.deadline for job in Jobs)
        slot = [-1] * (maxDeadline + 1)

        jobCount = 0
        totalProfit = 0

        for job in Jobs:
            for j in range(job.deadline, 0, -1):
                if slot[j] == -1:
                    slot[j] = job.id
                    jobCount += 1
                    totalProfit += job.profit
                    break
        return [jobCount, totalProfit]
