'''
Given a grid of size n*m (n is the number of rows and m is the number of columns in the grid) consisting of '0's (Water) and '1's(Land). Find the number of islands.

Note: An island is either surrounded by water or the boundary of a grid and is formed by connecting adjacent lands horizontally or vertically or diagonally i.e., in all 8 directions.
