'''
Given an array arr consisting of only 0's and 1's in random order. Modify the array in-place to segregate 0s onto the left side and 1s onto the right side of the array.
'''

#Solution Code


class Solution:
    def segregate0and1(self, arr):
        # Initialize a pointer for the next position to place a 0
        left = 0
        
        # Traverse through the array
        for i in range(len(arr)):
            if arr[i] == 0:
                # Swap arr[i] with arr[left], then move left pointer forward
                arr[i], arr[left] = arr[left], arr[i]
                left += 1

# Example usage:
if __name__ == "__main__":
    arr = [0, 0, 0, 1, 0]
    sol = Solution()
    sol.segregate0and1(arr)
