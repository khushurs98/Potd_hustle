'''
Given an array arr[][] such that arr[i][0] is the starting time of ith meeting and arr[i][1] is the ending time of ith meeting, the task is to check if it is possible for a person to attend all the meetings such that he can attend only one meeting at a particular time.

Note: A person can attend a meeting if its starting time is greater than or equal to the previous meeting's ending time.

class Solution:
    def canAttend(self, arr):
        arr.sort(key=lambda x: x[0])  
        for i in range(len(arr) - 1):
            if arr[i][1] > arr[i + 1][0]:  
                return False
        return True
