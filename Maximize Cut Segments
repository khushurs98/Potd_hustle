'''
Given an integer n denoting the Length of a line segment. You need to cut the line segment in such a way that the cut length of a line segment each time is either x , y or z. Here x, y, and z are integers.
After performing all the cut operations, your total number of cut segments must be maximum. Return the maximum number of cut segments possible.

Note: if no segment can be cut then return 0.

#Solution Code

class Solution:
    def maximizeTheCuts(self, n, x, y, z):
        dp = [-1] * (n + 1)
        dp[0] = 0

        cuts = [x, y, z]

        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            for cut in cuts:
                if i >= cut and dp[i - cut] != -1:
                    dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[i - cut] + 1)

        return dp[n] if dp[n] != -1 else 0
