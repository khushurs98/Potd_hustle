'''
You are given an array arr. Your task is to find the longest length of a good sequence. A good sequence {x1, x2, .. xn} is an alternating sequence if its elements satisfy one of the following relations :

1.  x1 < x2 > x3 < x4 > x5. . . . . and so on
2.  x1 >x2 < x3 > x4 < x5. . . . . and so on

        for i in range(1, len(arr)):
            if arr[i] > arr[i - 1]:
                up = down + 1
            elif arr[i] < arr[i - 1]:
                down = up + 1
        
        return max(up, down)
